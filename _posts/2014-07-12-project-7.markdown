description: App was created for my final year project at university. The application utilises the user's GPS coordinates to display nearby fuel stations, along with their latest user-inputted fuel prices. Gamification was used to reward user inputs for prices, available amenities at a fuel station, and reviews, with points that place them on a nationwide leaderboard. A leaderboard was also created for all the fuel stations in the system that ranks them on their fuel prices in ascending order.
