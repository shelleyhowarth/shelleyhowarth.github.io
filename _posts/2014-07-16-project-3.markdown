description: Project was assigned to me in final year of college. We were told to choose a dataset from Kaggle and to create a neural network using regression. I chose a dataset that contained details of houses along with the prices of them and built a model to predict the price of a house given other information about it (such as average area income, size, bedrooms etc.)
