description: Created a simulator of a supermarket using Go Lang. Scaled a 12 hour day into 60 seconds (run time of simulator). Customers were generated every x minutes (depending on the weather agent) and randomly allocated them a number of items between 1 and 200. Customers then had to queue for a checkout. 8 checkouts were created using Go routines. Each checkout had a different scanning speed and would open and close dynamically depending on how full the other queues were.
