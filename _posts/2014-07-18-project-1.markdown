description: Project was assigned to us in final year of college. We had to simulate a day in the supermarket and account for checkouts opening and closing as well as the constant flow of customers coming in. There were also a number of agents incorporated into the simulator that affected how the simulation ran such as the weather, length of queues and the speed of the scanners at the checkouts.
