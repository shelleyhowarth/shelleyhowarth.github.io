description: Project was assigned to a group of us in third year of college. We had to create an Android app so we created an equipment rental app for the UL Surf Club. I was responsible for implementing the Google Maps feature using the Google Maps API. I implemented highlighting a route from the user's coordinates to the boathouse (where to retrieve and return equipment).
